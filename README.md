Spring 25 Cubstart Decal Project

Project Name: vibecheck.fm

Team Members: Alexa Zhang, Cindy Wang, Erin Pan

Application description:

Our website will generate a playlist and color-schemed mood board based on how our user is feeling. Users select their mood (e.g., happy, sad, so-so, angry), and our website will direct them to a page where it gives a playlist and a background image with colored blocks generated using Color API to provide with music therapy, emotional support, and aesthetic vibes. 

Features + Tools/Technologies:

- Mood selection, hover effect, back to home button: html and javascript; react
- Playlist: spotify embedded playlist
- Aesthetic background: Color API

Timeline:
- Apr 21–24: build front page and enable scroll effects
- Apr 25–27: enable hover effects and connect with Color API
- Apr 28–30: find and embed spotify playlists, build back to home button
- May 1–2: polish layout and optimize user experience
- Our project group will be meeting three times in person each week
