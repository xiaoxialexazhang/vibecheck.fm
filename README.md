Spring 25 Cubstart Decal Project

Project Name: vibecheck.fm

Application description:

Our website will generate a custom playlist and digital mood board based on how our user is feeling. Users select their mood (e.g., happy, reflective, angsty), and the app gives a playlist and a background image with aesthetic vibes. The user will also be provided with sticker boards for each of the emotions, allowing them to customize their boards with appealing features. 

Features + Tools/Technologies:

- Mood selection: html and javascript; react
- Playlist: youtube iframe or spotify embed api
- Aesthetic image: colormind/coolors api
- Sticker board: GIPHY / Tenor api
- Drag & drop sticker feature: react-draggable / react-beautiful-dnd

Timeline:
- Apr 21–24: build mood form + styling
- Apr 25–27: connect apis for image and playlist
- Apr 28–30: assemble the sticker board and add drag and drop feature
- May 1–2: polish layout and optimize user experience
